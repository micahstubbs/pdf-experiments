Creating PDF Thumbnails with PDF.js

This is a simple demo to create PDF thumbnails with Javascript using [Mozilla's PDF JS](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/). This demo requires **Canvas** and possibly **Web Workers** Features in the browser. This demo reads PDF files from a specified path by making a AJAX request and
creates a thumbnail from the first page of the pdf files.
